Hari Hari Ramen is a restaurant that offers a social distancing ordering system at the restaurant. We aim to make contact between customers and our staff as little as possible. Hari Hari Ramen Web Application can be accessed via a QR Code at each table, and the customer can order the food using the web application, view order status and order history, call the waiter, and checkout. 

Customer will be logged in as a different account depending on the QR code they scan, and each table can only have one logged in user at a time. The menu browsing will be similar to most delivery apps, except for the ramen menus, where we have an interactive visual to make it more attractive to customers. Staff will be a person that can view order for all tables and they can edit the status of the order. Also, they can view for waiter calling. Moreover, they can check out the customer by scanner their QR code.
